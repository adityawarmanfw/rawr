# Native app architecture

`app/src/main/cpp` adapts the imaging backends in `native/` to Android camera,
Vulkan, capture storage, video surfaces, and JNI. Each resource has an owning
component; coordination happens in `session/`. Imaging algorithms remain in
the backend libraries.

## Structure and responsibilities

The tree below shows the main boundaries and their principal files. Existing
camera controls, metadata helpers, algorithms, writers, and shaders remain
beside the component that uses them.

## Dependency direction

`cmake/NativeModules.cmake` is the authoritative list of module dependencies.
The build defines a target for each module and links the JNI shared library
from those targets. The current graph has 22 modules, including JNI and the
four diagnostic modules.

    JNI[JNI] --> Session[Session composition]
    JNI --> Renderer[Editor renderer]
    Session --> Camera[Camera]
    Session --> Pipeline[Realtime pipeline]
    Session --> Capture[Capture]
    Session --> Video[Video]
    Session --> Replay[Diagnostic replay]

    Replay --> Encoding
    Encoding --> Develop
    Develop --> Values[Imaging / color / metadata / geometry / tone values]
    Develop --> Vulkan[Vulkan infrastructure]
    Video --> Vulkan
```

This diagram summarizes the main direction; the CMake manifest contains every
allowed edge. The pipeline has no concrete capture or session dependency.
Its three ports are implemented by `SessionFrameCallbacks`; passing that
adapter into a lower module does not give the module access to `SessionEngine`.
Capture, development, encoding, camera, video, and diagnostics do not reference
session implementations.

## Ownership and concurrency

- `SessionEngine` owns the transition mutex and Vulkan context. Its control
  translation units coordinate owners; they do not own a second copy of
  their resources. The former `CameraSession` aggregate has been removed.
- Camera callbacks enqueue move-only RAW leases or copied metadata. The
  ingress worker consumes events under the session transition mutex; the
  pairing/submission coordinator owns per-frame progression. Queue eviction,
  rejection, and destruction release image leases and acquire fences once.
- `FrameLimits.h` is the capacity source for six reader images, three GPU
  slots, one queued ingress image, and one paired image, with a compile-time
  budget check. Metadata capacities are eight ingress and three paired items.
- `RealtimePipeline` owns importer, preview, recorder, slot pool, and timing.
  `RealtimeResources` exposes borrowed pointers; frame submission cannot
  replace the owners' `unique_ptr` fields. `PreviewLookController` owns tone
  and film builds; `MonitorRecorder` owns only command-recording behavior.
- RAW ingress (`FrameSubmitCoordinator::ingestRaw`): RAW16 imports the camera
  AHB as an image (plus a storage buffer for buffer-direct reads). RAW10 imports
  the AHB as a storage buffer only, and `RawCpuUploadPool::gpuUnpack` hands out
  the pool's owned R16 slot image, which `acquireRawInputImage` fills with the
  `native/raw_ingress` unpacker. The camera fence then gates compute. If the
  import or the unpacker fails, the coordinator logs `RAW_INGRESS_FALLBACK` and
  latches to the CPU lock/unpack/upload (`RawCpuUploadPool::upload`).
  `debug.rawr.force_cpu_ingress 1` and the diagnostic modes keep the CPU route.
- `CaptureCoordinator` owns admission and the single/multiframe coordinators.
  Per-capture state is held in top-level jobs. The frozen RAW and burst
  contracts are separate from those coordinators. ZSL recording reserves an
  unready entry; successful queue submission commits it, retirement marks it
  ready, and failed submission discards it without consuming ring capacity.
- `VideoSession` owns the prewarm worker and settings. `VideoOutput` owns
  surface resources, `VideoProcessingResources` owns processing resources,
  and `VideoRecorder` records commands using those owners.
- `SingleFrameCaptureJob` coordinates independent DNG/JPEG outcomes through
  acquisition, journal, development, and output owners. Acquisition borrows a
  journal that outlives its worker. Frozen journal contexts contain no owning
  descriptors; output owners hold `UniqueFd` until the writer consumes it.
  The development owner retains mapped pixels until JPEG completion.
- `StillImageRenderer` owns the worker/completion facade. `RenderResources`
  owns private images, mapped buffers, engines/assets and per-engine keys;
  `RenderCommandSession` owns commands, fence and queries. The synchronous
  sequence preserves submission boundaries; readback consumes completed data.
  Engine persistence applies to pixel release; reset ends the resource lifetime.
- Camera helpers run under the controller's single state mutex. Callback guards
  separately protect admission/revocation and drain. The controller validates
  generation before reading request provenance; result processing returns actions.
  Preview/reader setup and cleanup run outside the camera mutex. Cleanup carries
  the retired reader generation, so it cannot destroy a newer reader.
- `VulkanContext` owns one `QueueSubmission` per actual queue. If multiframe
  work uses the primary queue, it shares the primary mutex. Backend adapters
  that still take a mutex borrow this same authority; some retain direct
  `vkQueueSubmit` calls within that lock. Command pools belong to their
  resource owner, not to the queue authority. Whole-device idle waits acquire
  the actual queues' submission locks through `VulkanContext::waitIdle()`.
- `CameraCallbackLifetime` gates callback admission and counts callbacks
  admitted before revocation. Device closure and request/output teardown
  retain the existing asynchronous Camera2 policy, including forced-orphan
  handling; handles live in `CameraDeviceSession`.

Shutdown first joins prewarm/look workers, shuts down camera callbacks, and
drains the ingress worker. It then stops video and releases cached video
processing, shuts down still work, waits for GPU work, and releases reader,
realtime/capture resources, swapchain, and surface before destroying Vulkan.
The capture owner and frame callback adapter outlive the frame coordinator.
Surface detach can remain deferred while independent still work is active.

## Shared contracts and compatibility

- `DevelopSettings` holds development intent. `JpegCaptureContext` holds
  encoding options, output descriptor, provenance, and EXIF. `CaptureRequest`
  combines them. Capture and editor JNI share decoding/default helpers;
  `DevelopContextBuilder` shares render-field projection while source geometry
  and noise preparation remain in their workflows.
- `RawSnapshot` and `FrozenBurst` carry acquired data across stages without
  depending on a session object. `UniqueFd`, `RawFrameLease`, and
  `CommandResources` express transfer of ownership.
- JNI entry points and payloads, durable journal versions and field order,
  demosaic enum representation, shader parameters, queue capacities, and the
  uncompiled burst stub are preserved. Shaders live beside their consumer;
  native imaging math was not changed by the extraction.
- Existing algorithm namespaces such as `develop::rendered` and
  `develop::demosaic::rcd` remain while the directory tree is shallower.

## Validation

See [host behavior tests](../../../../tests/README.md) for ownership, persistence,
and image-format regression checks. Module dependencies are declared in CMake.
